# DataSciencePOC
This data science project focuses on predicting the probability of a heart attack using machine learning techniques. The system leverages historical medical data stored in a provided .csv file, containing key health metrics and patient information.

The project implements two core algorithms:

**Naive Bayes Algorithm:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem, which is effective for predicting outcomes by calculating conditional probabilities.
**Decision Tree Algorithm:** A tree-structured classifier that makes predictions by splitting the data into branches based on feature values, making it easy to interpret.
# Key Features:
**Data Input:** The system utilizes a .csv file of historical medical records to train the model.
**Naive Bayes Model:** Predicts heart attack probability based on the relationships between input features (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, etc.).
**Decision Tree Model:** Provides an interpretable model by identifying key factors contributing to heart attack risk.
**Comparison of Algorithms:** The project compares the performance of Naive Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms in predicting heart attack risk, enabling insights into which approach is more effective for this dataset.
